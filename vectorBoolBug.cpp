std::vector<bool> is a special case in C++ that doesn't behave like other standard containers.  It's often implemented using bit manipulation for space efficiency, but this leads to surprising behavior. For example, iterators aren't guaranteed to be pointers, and element access isn't always as straightforward as with other vector types.  This can cause subtle bugs if developers assume it's a typical vector.
